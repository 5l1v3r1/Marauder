# Marauder
 
*A .NET agent for Faction*

Marauder is an extendable agent for the Faction C2 Framework. It leverages Faction .NET modules to easily add features and functionality when you need them.

## Using Marauder
For the most part, Marauder is straight forward implementation of a Faction agent. This means that [common commands](https://www.factionc2.com/docs/agents/) work as expected.

One thing that is unique to Marauder is its tasks system. Using the `tasks` command will show you any tasks currently running in your Marauder agent. If you'd like to kill a task, use `tasks /kill:[task id]`
